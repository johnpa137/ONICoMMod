# ONICoMMod
Trying to do add conservation of mass to ONI, slowly

changes so far:

algae terrarium now produces oxygen and new algae from water and co2 in the environment

oxygen diffuser, renamed to algae pyrolyser, outputs coal and steam by breaking down algae, will need to add an emptying job for the coal produced


updated descriptions for two buildings and algae to reflect changes

next step is the outhouse

INSTALLING:

just put the dll under /mods/dev/ in the ONI install directory.

Should work if you have the ModLoader.dll
