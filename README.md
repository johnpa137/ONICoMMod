# ONICoMMod
Trying to do add conservation of mass to ONI, slowly

changes so far:

algae terrarium now produces oxygen and new algae from water and co2 in the environment
oxygen diffuser, renamed to algae pyrolyser, outputs coal and steam by breaking down algae

updated descriptions for two buildings and algae to reflect changes

next step is the outhouse
